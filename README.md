# Fingerprint_Based_ATM-_Transaction-System

We've analysed the problems faced in existing ATM transaction and proposed an idea and a prototype to use more efficiently the system.

We have used Figma tool to create a prototype version of ATM machine accessed by fingerprint as well as PIN. 

Note: Below mentioned images are created as a prototype by tool.
